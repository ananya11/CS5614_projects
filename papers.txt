A Framework for Summarizing and Analyzing Twitter Feeds

This paper proposes a move technic to analyze and summarize twitter data. The proposed method is light weight because it is an incremental summary construction which is efficient. It also enables low reconstruction error.

Graph-of-word and TW-IDF: New Approach to Ad Hoc IR 

By analogy with TF-IDF model, they proposed a new technic TW-IDF model which assigns term weights (TW) rather than term frequency. They capture the relationship between terms using unweighted graphs and extract meaningful term weights. We plan to add term weights to our list of words in feature list to increase accuracy of our classifier and we feel this model might lead us to the right direction.

Is Top-k Sufficient for Ranking?


This paper is an empirical study of top-k learning to rank training . The challenge in learning to rank algorithms is getting reliable  training data. So top k learning algorithm proposes to utilize top-k ground truth for training where k is usually small. The underlying assumption is that training on top-k grade truth is as good as full-order ranking list. They study whether this underlying assumption of top-k learning ground-truth is sufficient for training holds.
